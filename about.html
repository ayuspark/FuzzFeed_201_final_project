              <p>Harro everyone! I come to coding school to become a Chinese hacker,
              my government has sponsored me to come and learn about your society.
              They chose me because of my extensive knowledge in
              panda espionage, which will pave the way for Panda Express annihilation!
              But for realsies I enjoy chicken feet, they are disgusting and tender</p>

              You can find me playing Injustice 2 or Battlefield 1.
              Recently became vegan(It doesn't count if I don't tell everyone).
              I recommend reading "Ender's Game" by Orson Scott Card and "The Gates of Fire" by steven presfield.
              Kendrick, J.Cole, Logic and Eminem are on repeat in my car, deal with it.</p>

              <p>Jack of all trades, master of none. Phil enjoys playing soccer and beach volleyball when not behind a screen. If you can't find him, make sure you check the closest Irish Pub from where he was seen last and you will probably find him sitting at the bar with a pint of Smithwicks and a glass of Jameson. Other than that his life revolves around his Golden Lab Stella.</p>

              <p>Hailing from Windsor, Ontario Canada, Adam enjoys sitting quietly and/or staring out the window at nothing in particular. On a list of hobbies he would have: Hiking, camping, video games, and going to the movies. Of 3 siblings, Adam is his mother’s favorite — he knows. During the creation of this project, Adam voted himself the fourth Most Valuable Contributor behind only Lola, Philip and Brandon. Adam’s future plans include finishing 301; heading onto and the completion of 401; then while conducting his job search, win the lottery and retire to his estate where he will sit quietly and stare out the window for the rest of his days. He’s also super single. Long walks. Beaches. Candle light.</p>
